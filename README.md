This repository contains oTree apps to implement two versions of the Preference Survey Module:

* **Preference Survey Module, Laboratory Version**: an experimentally validated survey to measure six key economic preferences (risk aversion, patience, trust, altruism, positive and negative reciprocity) in a reliable, parsimonious and cost-effective way introduced by Falk, Armin, Anke Becker, Thomas Dohmen, David Huffman, and Uwe Sunde (2016), "The Preference Survey Module: A Validated Instrument for Measuring Risk, Time, and Social Preferences", IZA Discussion Paper No. 9674.

* **Preference Survey Module, Streamlined Version (also known as Global Preference Survey)**: the streamlined version of the Preference Survey Module that has been optimized and piloted for applications where time efficiency and simplicity are paramount, such as international telephone surveys. This version of the PSM was used in Falk, Armin, Anke Becker, Thomas Dohmen, Benjamin Enke, David Huffman, and Uwe Sunde (2018), "Global Evidence on Economic Preferences", Quarterly Journal of Economics, 133(4), 1645-1692.

The modules to measure Risk Aversion Quantitative and Patience Quantitative build on the oTree apps to measure risk taking developed by Felix Holzmeister at the University of Innsbruck (https://www.holzmeister.biz). 

This app was developed with oTree version 2.5.7.
